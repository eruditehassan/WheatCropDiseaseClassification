<h1 align="center">Wheat Crop Stripe Rust Disease Classification</h1>

<p align="center">
  <i>Wheat is a staple crop that is grown across the world due to its substantial contribution to human nutrition. Its significance is evident as it provides almost 20% of calories and protein required for daily human consumption. However, wheat yield is affected by rust disease that can reduce 30% of wheat production which is a serious threat to food security. In order to minimize the loss, it is crucial to identify precisely and localize the wheat rust disease and its infection types. This repository is a subset of a larger project, and the focus is some of the important machine learning aspects of the project</i>
